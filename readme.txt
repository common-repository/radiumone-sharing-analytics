Po.st encourages social sharing, tracks dark social sharing of your content, provides comprehensive analytics and actionable reporting.

== Description ==

Po.st is the leading sharing platform that has the capability to track 100% of the social activity of your site, including the elusive actions of dark social. Dark Social is the action of users copying text from your site and sharing with friends directly through IM, Text, Email and social networks. Want to know how much engagement you're getting from copy/paste actions? You should! It's the #1 way users are sharing content online and it's not even close. Be in the know.

The Po.st plugin includes access to all major social channels including Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Email, Reddit and more. Po.st offers an array of button styles and formations as wellâ€”choose from small, medium or large buttons, placed vertically or horizontally, with or without share counters, the options are nearly limitless. Po.st is also formatted for mobile, which can include mobile specific sharing buttons like WhatsApp, SMS and Line.

Tracking 100% of the sharing activity is only the beginning. Po.st captures and analyzes this data in real time and provides an analytics dashboard that breakdowns your activity in a comprehensive way. Find out what, where, when and how users are sharing your sites content. Through these insights and support from your dedicated Account Manager, you'll be able to optimize your content based on its popularity and what users are engaging with the most! Also, with our additional features such as Viral Alert notifications, you can be informed immediately when content begins to take off so you can take action to further its promotion.
